In this paper, the authors propose a strategy where flow permitted to access the station platforms is capped in real-time, using a capacity reduction at the automated fare collection (AFC) gates.
Two control strategies are simulated: this first one aims to limit the boarding and alighting time at 17 seconds, the second one to 15 seconds. These strategies look successful to reduce some of these small delays, but increase dramatically the density before the gates, especially the second strategy.

Authors chose to collect actual data about the train gates that are (not equally) used in the station which is appreciable. It is also greatly appreciable that both these metrics are considered in the paper. However, a global metric such as gained or lost time (time gained by those on the not-delayed trains - individual time lost by those retained at the AFC gates) would be useful to better understand how this measure can be powerful.
