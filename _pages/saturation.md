Ongoing work to find a common method to assess station saturation

Focus on critical elements or global evaluation? Which decile consider? (ie the x most saturated %) Which data is available and reliable?

First indicators : increased travel time due to saturation, saturation-induced delays, number of choices, flowd index, saturation direct and indirect costsâ€¦
