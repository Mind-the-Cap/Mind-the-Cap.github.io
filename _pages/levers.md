**Separating flow and counterflow by a barrier in a corridor**
ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Lausanne station (Switzerland) {: .notice}

The barrier is installed in the underpass between the metro station of Lausanne station and the station herself.
It looks permanently activated, however it is mainly useful when massive flows come from the metro station, when trains end their southbound journey on the northbound platform, causing a massive counterflow.
Using a barrier helps to separate the flow in two and avoids any blockage. Gates at the end of each corridor part ensure unidirectional flows.
