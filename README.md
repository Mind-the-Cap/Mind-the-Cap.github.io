This observatory aims to propose:
* an assessment of the crowd risk in railway context
* a collection of levers that may be used in stations and trains
* a global evaluation of congestion in stations around the world.

The observatory is currently built by Capucine-Marin Dubroca-Voisin from AREP, in collaboration with others, but this work has not been officially approved by AREP yet and the company cannot be responsible for its use.
